Project description: “Adopt a Pet”
You love animals and think it is time to adopt one. You like all sorts of animals: small animals, large animals, you may like reptiles and birds and may be open to adopting animals of any age. 

Let's then create an animal adoption platform to connect users (people interested in adopting pets) and animals (pets interested in being adopted). 

All users must introduce their first_name and last_name, email, phone_number, address, picture and password in order to register on the platform.

All animals must have a name, a photo and live at a specific location(a single line like “Praterstrasse 23” is enough). They also have a description, size, age, vaccinated, must belong to a breed and have a status "Adopted" or "Available".
